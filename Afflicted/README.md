# Afflicted-TBC-Classic

Afflicted is an enemy spell timer mod for PvP (mainly arenas). This is for people who just want useful information, such as an interrupt is on cool down and you're safe to cast a heal or that Blessing of Freedom is going to be back up for an enemy Paladin soon. If you want to know the cool down of an obscure ability say Whirlwind then this is not the mod for you. New timers for abilities that are not included by default can easily be added under the configuration. The system is flexible enough that any enemy timer can be added including traps or totems.

Alerts for when a spell is triggered (or ends), as well as when you interrupt or dispel an enemy are included. All alerts can be shown inside party, raid, raid warning, combat text or a specified chat frame.
